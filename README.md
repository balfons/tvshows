## 🛠️ Build for production

## ⌛️ A couple of things i would have done if I had more time

- I would have added more tests
- I would have organized reusable css variables in a separate file
- I would have explored how this could be done with SSR (Next.js)
- I would have added a service worker for better offline support
- I would have added navigation between the details page and the list page
